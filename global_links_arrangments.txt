- originals arrangements:

1- absolute: allocation of global links consists of connecting the routers in each group in consecutive order, with the groups in the
network also in consecutive order, always starting from group 0 and skipping those links with source and destination being in the same group.
                         
2- relative: allocation of global links consists of connecting the first half of the routers in the first half of the groups to the second half of the routers of the second half of the groups.

originally, there are two different implementations; one works only on the maximum number of groups (a*h + 1), the other one works on some cases where g < max number of groups.

3- circulant: allocation of global links consists of connecting half of the global links for a group with the successor groups and the other half to the predecessor groups.

- the improved arrangement for originals ones
4- absolute improved: similar to the absolute method but it shifts the destination switch index by one every time all groups are visited.
Therefore, the result of this arrangement is not isomorphic to absolute (in the cases where absolute is work), and it slightly lowers the load in the local links because it increases the number of 2 hops paths and decrees the number of 3 hops paths. Unlike absolute arrangement, this works on any number of groups.

- absolute improved2: this will iterate over group instead of the nodes inside the groups.

5- relative improved:  an improved version of relative arrangement that visit have of the nodes and make bidirectional links instead of unidirectional links, therefore, it works on any number of groups.

- new random approach 
6- random: in this arrangement, the algorithm randomly picks two groups with least global links then randomly select switch with the least connections in each group and connect them. Repeated until each switch has the required degree.
This approach results in disconnected groups.

7-  greedy random: in this global links arrangement, we start by making one links between every two groups, then make the random method.

8- leftover greedy random: in this arrangement, the algorithm begins by t round of absolute_imporved or greedy random, then use a greedy random approach to link the leftover links.
t = (a * h)/(g-1)  

notation:
h: number of global links per router
n: the total number of routers in the network
g: total group number
a: number of routers in each group
